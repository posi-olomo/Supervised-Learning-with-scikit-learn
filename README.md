# Supervised-Learning-with-scikit-learn
This repository contains my code from the datacamp course "Supervised Learning with scikit-learn"
Hello, I doubt I will make this public but in the meantime I am Posi and I like Machine Learning. This is all new to me, the coding environment but it is also VERY exciting, I can't wait to see where this goes. 
I really do not think anyone will use my code but you never know.
Well, good bye and have a nice day.
